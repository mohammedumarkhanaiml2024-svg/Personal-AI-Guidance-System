## üß† AI Model Features Explained

### Input Features ‚Üí How Data is Used

The system collects comprehensive data about your daily life:

```python
# Example: Daily Habit Tracking
{
  "date": "2025-10-01",
  "sleep_hours": 7.5,
  "wake_up_time": "06:30",
  "work_study_hours": 6.0,
  "exercise_minutes": 45,
  "reading_minutes": 30,
  "social_media_minutes": 120,
  "meditation_minutes": 15,
  "procrastination_level": 3
}
```

This data becomes **input features** for AI models that:
- Profile your behavior patterns
- Predict future habits
- Generate personalized recommendations
- Identify areas for improvement

### AI Capabilities ‚Üí What You Get

#### 1. **User Profiling**
```
Profile Analysis for john_doe:
Consistency Score: 7.2/10

Key Strengths:
‚úì Maintains healthy sleep schedule
‚úì High task completion rate (78%)

Areas for Improvement:
‚ö† Insufficient sleep (avg 6.2h/night)
‚ö† Inconsistent exercise (30% of days)

Behavioral Patterns:
‚Ä¢ Sleep deprivation pattern detected
```

#### 2. **Personalized Recommendations**
```json
{
  "recommendation_type": "schedule",
  "title": "Improve Sleep Schedule",
  "description": "You're averaging 6.2 hours of sleep. Try shifting your bedtime 30 minutes earlier.",
  "priority": "high",
  "actionable_steps": [
    "Set a bedtime alarm 30 minutes before target sleep time",
    "Avoid screens 1 hour before bed",
    "Create a calming bedtime routine"
  ]
}
```

#### 3. **Routine Prediction**
Predicts when you'll be most productive and which habits you're likely to maintain:
```json
{
  "predicted_productive_hours": ["09:00-10:00", "14:00-15:00"],
  "habit_predictions": {
    "exercise": 0.65,  // 65% chance you'll exercise
    "meditation": 0.85, // 85% chance you'll meditate
    "reading": 0.45
  }
}
```

#### 4. **Habit Analytics**
Comprehensive analytics with trends and insights:
```
Period: Last 30 Days

‚úì Great sleep habits! You're averaging 7.5h/night
‚úì Exercise routine is improving over time!
üî• Amazing meditation streak of 14 days!
‚ö† Social media usage increasing (avg 2.5h/day)
```

#### 5. **Conversational AI Mentor**
Chat with an AI that knows your context:
```
You: "I'm feeling stressed about work deadlines"

AI: "I can see your stress levels have been high lately (7.5/10). 
Here's what might help:
1. Your productivity peaks at 9-10 AM - schedule important tasks then
2. You've been skipping meditation - even 10 minutes can help
3. Your exercise streak was great last week - getting back to it 
   can reduce stress significantly.

Remember, you completed 78% of tasks last month. You've got this! üí™"
```
